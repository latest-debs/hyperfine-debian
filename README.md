# hyperfine for Debian

[hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) — a command-line benchmarking tool — packaged for
Debian as part of [latest-debs](https://github.com/latest-debs).

## Install

Via the latest-debs apt repository:

## Building

Run the [Build hyperfine for Debian](../../actions) workflow on GitHub with the
desired upstream version. Packaging is driven by
[debian-multiarch-builder](https://github.com/ranjithrajv/debian-multiarch-builder).

## Maintainers wanted

This package doesn't have a dedicated maintainer yet — **we'd love for you
to sign up!** Maintaining just means keeping an eye on new upstream
releases and build breaks; the build itself is automated. Interested? Open
an issue on this repo to volunteer, or say hello in
[org discussions](https://github.com/orgs/latest-debs/discussions) — all
skill levels welcome.

## Disclaimer

Unofficial packaging only. For issues with hyperfine itself, see
